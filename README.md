# üß† Welcome to the Fall 2025 SURGE BrainHACK!

Welcome to the **SURGE BrainHACK 2025**, where you'll get hands-on experience developing Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and analyzing neural data. Over the course of this weekend, you'll work in teams to prototype applications using EEG data.

# üèÜ Challenge Streams
We have **two challenge tracks** you can choose from:

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Brain-Controlled Applications (Real-Time BCI)**
**üéØ Challenge & Goal:** Develop an application where EEG signals **control an interaction or interface** in real time. Use real-time EEG to build a brain-controlled game, assistive tool, interactive experience, or whatever you brainstorm!

**Example Ideas:**
   - A **Mind-controlled game**
   - A **An EEG-controlled communication device**
   - A **mind-controlled music device**

### Real-Time BCI Deliverables

- **Project Presentation** (12 minutes max.) - See the [rubric for details.](./resources/judging_rubrics.md#brain-controlled-applications-real-time-bci-stream) A general template for your presentation should include:
  -  Problem Statement & Motivation  
  - System Design & Implementation 
  - A live Demonstration (or a pre-recorded demo if real-time is not possible)  
  - Results & Interpretation (system performance, user interaction)
  - Challenges & Future Work
- **Code Repository** (GitHub or Zip file) ‚Äì Should include:  
  - Your code, presentation and instructions for running the project (a readme file)


## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Offline EEG Data Analysis & Machine Learning**
**üéØ Challenge & Goal:** Analyze pre-recorded EEG data to extract insights, perform statistics, classify brain signals/states, or detect anomalies.

**BCI Dataset:** For this stream we have provided three datasets of EEG recordings from participants subjected to various experimental conditions designed to elicit specific neural responses. For more information on the provided dataset, please refer to the [dataset description](./offline-analysis-stream/dataset_description.md).
- **You may find and use a different, publicly available dataset for your analysis**. However, if you choose to use another dataset, volunteers may not be able to provide as much support.

### Offline EEG Data/ML Deliverables

- **Project Presentation** (12 minutes max.) - see the [rubric for details.](./resources/judging_rubrics.md#offline-eeg-data-analysis--machine-learning-stream) A general template for your presentation should include:
  - Problem Statement & Motivation  
  - What you did with the data (preprocessing, analysis, modeling) 
  - Results & Interpretation (accuracy, feature importance, visualization of findings, etc.)  
  - Challenges & Future Work  
- **Report (Recommended)** ‚Äì A Jupyter Notebook or PDF report summarizing:
  - You could even make a report and use it for your presentation!
  - Your data analysis process (where did you start, what did you try, what worked) and key insights; visualizations, results, and interpretation of findings.
- **Code Repository** (GitHub or Zip file) ‚Äì Should include:  
  - Your code/analyses, presentation and instructions for running the project (a readme file)

# üì© Submission Information

- **Submission Deadline: Sunday, 1:00 PM**
- **Judging Format:** A **short presentation** followed by a **5-minute Q&A** session from the judges.
  - Order of team presentations will be decided at random.
- **Judging Criteria:** Projects will be evaluated based on the [rubrics provided for each challenge stream.](./resources/judging_rubrics.md)
- **Prizes:** Top teams from each stream will bragging rights, a great addition to your CV, and sweet SURGE swag prizes!

### Submission Process
- **How to Submit:**  
  - Upload your presentation, code, reports, and any other relevant files to your Github repository.
    - If files are too large, or you don't have a Github repository, you can submit a zip file.
    - Ensure it includes a *README* explaining about (and how to run/use) your project. 
  - **[Submit through the submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc65U8UJwx7-sMt4GFWles26xFzohy9mJT58iCGx3GzYFaYJA/viewform?usp=header)**
- **NOTE:** If you submit multiple times, only your most recent submission made before the submission deadline (1:00 pm on Sunday) will be considered. Submissions received after the deadline will not be accepted.
