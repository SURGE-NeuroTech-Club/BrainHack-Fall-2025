  - Submission Deadline: Sunday @ 1:00 PM
  - Presentations: 1:10 PM - 3:00 PM

## Rules:
1. You are free to use any hardware or software tools you like, but we recommend using the resources provided in this repository.
2. You may work in teams of up to 4 people. Individual submissions are also allowed.
3. All work must be done during the hackathon period (Friday to Sunday).
4. You must submit your project by the deadline to be eligible for judging.
5. You are allowed to - even encouraged to use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) to assist with coding, brainstorming, and problem-solving. **However, it is your responsibility to ensure that you understand and can explain all of your work!**
6. Have fun and be creative!

# 🏆 Challenge Streams
We have **two challenge tracks** you can choose from:

## **1️⃣ Brain-Controlled Applications (Real-Time BCI)**
**🎯 Challenge & Goal:** Develop an application where EEG signals **control an interaction or interface** in real time. Use real-time EEG to build a brain-controlled game, assistive tool, interactive experience, or whatever you brainstorm!

**Example Ideas:**
   - A **Mind-controlled game**
   - A **An EEG-controlled communication device**
   - A **mind-controlled music device**

### Real-Time BCI Deliverables

- **Project Presentation** (12 minutes max.) - See the [rubric for details.](./resources/judging_rubrics.md#brain-controlled-applications-real-time-bci-stream) A general template for your presentation should include:
  -  Problem Statement & Motivation  
  - System Design & Implementation 
  - A live Demonstration (or a pre-recorded demo if real-time is not possible)  
  - Results & Interpretation (system performance, user interaction)
  - Challenges & Future Work
- **Code Repository** (GitHub or Zip file) – Should include:  
  - Your code, presentation and instructions for running the project (a readme file)


## **2️⃣ Offline EEG Data Analysis & Machine Learning**
**🎯 Challenge & Goal:** Analyze pre-recorded EEG data to extract insights, perform statistics, classify brain signals/states, or detect anomalies.

**BCI Dataset:** For this stream we have provided three datasets of EEG recordings from participants subjected to various experimental conditions designed to elicit specific neural responses. For more information on the provided dataset, please refer to the [dataset description](./offline-analysis-stream/dataset_description.md).
- **You may find and use a different, publicly available dataset for your analysis**. However, if you choose to use another dataset, volunteers may not be able to provide as much support.

### Offline EEG Data/ML Deliverables

- **Project Presentation** (12 minutes max.) - see the [rubric for details.](./resources/judging_rubrics.md#offline-eeg-data-analysis--machine-learning-stream) A general template for your presentation should include:
  - Problem Statement & Motivation  
  - What you did with the data (preprocessing, analysis, modeling) 
  - Results & Interpretation (accuracy, feature importance, visualization of findings, etc.)  
  - Challenges & Future Work  
- **Report (Recommended)** – A Jupyter Notebook or PDF report summarizing:
  - You could even make a report and use it for your presentation!
  - Your data analysis process (where did you start, what did you try, what worked) and key insights; visualizations, results, and interpretation of findings.
- **Code Repository** (GitHub or Zip file) – Should include:  
  - Your code/analyses, presentation and instructions for running the project (a readme file)

# 📩 Submission Information

- **Submission Deadline: Sunday, 1:00 PM**
- **Judging Format:** A **short presentation** followed by a **5-minute Q&A** session from the judges.
  - Order of team presentations will be decided at random.
- **Judging Criteria:** Projects will be evaluated based on the [rubrics provided for each challenge stream.](./resources/judging_rubrics.md)
- **Prizes:** Top teams from each stream will bragging rights, a great addition to your CV, and sweet SURGE swag prizes!

### Submission Process
- **How to Submit:**  
  - Upload your presentation, code, reports, and any other relevant files to your Github repository.
    - If files are too large, or you don't have a Github repository, you can submit a zip file.
    - Ensure it includes a *README* explaining about (and how to run/use) your project. 
  - **[Submit through the submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc65U8UJwx7-sMt4GFWles26xFzohy9mJT58iCGx3GzYFaYJA/viewform?usp=header)**
- **NOTE:** If you submit multiple times, only your most recent submission made before the submission deadline (1:00 pm on Sunday) will be considered. Submissions received after the deadline will not be accepted.
