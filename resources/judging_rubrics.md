# Judging Rubrics  
This document outlines the judging criteria for the two challenge streams in the BrainHack Fall 2025 event. Each stream has its own specific deliverables and evaluation metrics.  

---

## Brain-Controlled Applications (Real-Time BCI) Stream  
Projects in this track focus on **real-time EEG processing** and **user interaction**.  

### Real-Time BCI Deliverables  
- **Project Presentation** (Problem, Design, Demo, Results, Challenges)  
- **Code Repository** (GitHub or Zip file) â€“ code, presentation, and README with instructions  

### Judging Criteria (Total: 100 points)  

| **Category** | **Criteria** | **Excellent (75â€“100%)** | **Proficient (50â€“74%)** | **Limited (<50%)** | **Score** |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Presentation & Learning (75 pts)** | **Clarity & Structure** (/15) | 12â€“15 pts: Clear, logical, well-structured; flows smoothly | 8â€“11 pts: Mostly clear, some gaps in structure | 0â€“7 pts: Disorganized, difficult to follow | **/15** |
| | **System Explanation** (/15) | 12â€“15 pts: Strong understanding of BCI pipeline (processing, control, interaction) | 8â€“11 pts: Basic understanding; some details missing | 0â€“7 pts: Limited or incorrect explanation | **/15** |
| | **Demonstration Effectiveness** (/25) | 19â€“25 pts: Demo runs smoothly, clearly shows real-time functionality & interaction | 13â€“18 pts: Demo works partially or with issues | 0â€“12 pts: Demo missing, fails, or unclear | **/25** |
| | **Learning & Reflection** (/20) | 15â€“20 pts: Explains what was tried, what worked/didnâ€™t, and lessons learned | 10â€“14 pts: Some reflection, limited depth | 0â€“9 pts: Little or no reflection | **/20** |
| **Code & Documentation (25 pts)** | **Documentation** (/25) | 19â€“25 pts: Well-documented repo with README; easy to run and understand | 13â€“18 pts: Some documentation; runnable with effort | 0â€“12 pts: Poorly documented; hard to use | **/25** |

ðŸ“Œ **Total Score:** **/100 points**

## Offline EEG Data Analysis & Machine Learning Stream  
Projects in this track focus on **processing pre-recorded EEG data**, applying **machine learning** or **statistical analysis**, and deriving meaningful insights from neural activity.  

### Offline EEG Data/ML Deliverables  
- **Project Presentation** (Problem, Methods, Results, Challenges)  
- **Report (Recommended)** â€“ Jupyter Notebook or PDF with workflow, insights, results  
- **Code Repository** â€“ code/analyses, presentation, README with instructions  

### Judging Criteria (Total: 100 points)  

| **Category** | **Criteria** | **Excellent (75â€“100%)** | **Proficient (50â€“74%)** | **Limited (<50%)** | **Score** |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Presentation & Learning (65 pts)** | **Clarity & Structure** (/10) | 8â€“10 pts: Clear, logical, easy to follow | 5â€“7 pts: Mostly clear; minor gaps | 0â€“4 pts: Confusing, disorganized | **/10** |
| | **Learning & Reflection** (/20) | 15â€“20 pts: Strong reflection; explains process & lessons learned | 10â€“14 pts: Some reflection, partial learning | 0â€“9 pts: Little/no reflection | **/20** |
| | **Results Communication** (/20) | 15â€“20 pts: Results clearly presented with visuals & interpretation | 10â€“14 pts: Some visuals or interpretation, lacks depth | 0â€“9 pts: Results unclear, visuals missing | **/20** |
| | **Engagement & Delivery** (/15) | 12â€“15 pts: Engaging, confident, accessible | 8â€“11 pts: Adequate, some lapses | 0â€“7 pts: Flat, unclear, hard to follow | **/15** |
| **Notebook & Code (35 pts)** | **Documentation** (/20) | 15â€“20 pts: Notebook/report clearly explains workflow, results, insights | 10â€“14 pts: Mostly clear, some gaps | 0â€“9 pts: Minimal or missing documentation | **/20** |
| | **Clarity & Usability** (/15) | 12â€“15 pts: Code easy to follow, well-commented, approachable | 8â€“11 pts: Understandable with effort | 0â€“7 pts: Hard to follow; poorly structured | **/15** |

ðŸ“Œ **Total Score:** **/100 points**
